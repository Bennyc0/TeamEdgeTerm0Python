# Day 1 Challenges: 
# -------------------------------------------- 

# Example
message="Hello World!"
print(message)

# -------------------------------------------- 
# Challenge 1:
# 
# Imagine it's the first day of class. (Wait, it is the first day isn't it..Deja vu?) 
# Everyone's participating in an icebreaker and has to introduce themselves. 
# It goes something like: 
# (Hint: Remove the # signs in front of the print statements below so your code will run!)
# -------------------------------------------- 

print("\n------------------- Challenge 1 -------------------\n")

name='Benny'
grade=9
funFact="... I don't think I have one"

print(f'Hi! My name is {name}.')
print('Data type: String\n')
print(f"I'm in the {grade}th grade.")
print('Data type: Int\n')
print(f'A fun fact about me is that {funFact}.')
print('Data type: String\n\n\n')

# --------------------------------------------

HappyBirthday='Happy Birthday to you'

print(f'{HappyBirthday},\n{HappyBirthday}.')
print(f'Happy Birthday dear {name},')
print(f'{HappyBirthday}.')


# **** Challenge 1: Problem 1 ****
# Initialize the variables used in the {} with your data for the three statements above! 
# Hint: Also think about where you would initialize those variables


# **** Upchallenge! ****
# Can you also print out the data type of the variables? 




# **** Challenge 1: Problem 2 ****
# Create a string for the different lines of the Happy Birthday Song
# Print out the song using the strings you declared.




# **** Challenge 1: Problem 3 ****
# Print out a string that has brackets in it.




# -------------------------------------------- 
# Challenge 2: 
# Below is a set of problems to help you solidify your understanding of math operators
# Write your solution code under each commented problem. 
# -------------------------------------------- 

print("\n------------------- Challenge 2 -------------------\n")

# Here are some variables to get you started
num1=5
num2=10
sum=num1+num2
difference=sum+7
product=difference*3
power=product**2
quotient=power/4
remainder=quotient%2


print(f'Sum is {sum}')
print(f'Difference is {difference}')
print(f'Product is {product}')
print(f'Power is {power}')
print(f'Quotient is {quotient}')
print(f'Remainder is {remainder}\n')

# **** Challenge 2: Problem 1 ****
# Store the sum of num1 and num2 in a variable.
# Print the sum.


# **** Challenge 2: Problem 2 ****
# Store the difference between sum (above) and 7 in a variable.
# Print the difference.


# **** Challenge 2: Problem 3 ****
# Store the product of the difference and 3 in a variable.
# Print the product.


# **** Challenge 2: Problem 4 ****
# Store the power of the product squared in a variable.
# Print the power.


# **** Challenge 2: Problem 5 ****
# Store the quotient of the power divided by 4 in a variable.
# Print the quotient.


# **** Challenge 2: Problem 6 ****
# Store the remainder of the quotient divided by 2 in a variable.
# Print the remainder.


# **** Upchallenge! ****
# Given a variable that stores a number, print the values that come right before and right after.
# For example, given the number 4, the program should print 3 and 5. 
# Your code should work even if the value of the variable is changed.

num1 = 9
sum1 = num1+1
difference1 = num1-1

print(f'Values are {sum1}, and {difference1}\n')
